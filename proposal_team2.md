## Project: Prog Course Support Site

### Akhil's Comments:

good. very thorough proposal. 

### Professor's Comments:

Looks great.  Plenty of work to do for three.  Still, be careful to prioritize the implementation of the features of your project so you can still give a reasonable demo, even if you cannot get everything done.  The Sprint presentations will also help in this regard because you'll be asked to show us some partial implementation of your site.  The list of technologies used is great.
